Project: Sticky Fingers is the development name for this game about legitimate business dealings.\n\n    In it, you assume the role of a humble merchant. One that happens to specialize in goods with an interesting history of ownership.\n\n    Make deals, establish clients, acquire inventory, and evade the grasp of legal sticklers that don't appreciate your novel take on entrepreneurship.\n\n    Maybe you'll rule a brightness-challenged market some day... stranger things have happened.
